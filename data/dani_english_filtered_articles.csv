A trained medical technician takes about 15 min to evaluate and count 100 cells for each blood slide, a time consuming and susceptible to error procedure. Leukocyte shape is usually insufficient to differentiate even among normal types since it varies widely. The current paper addresses the pattern recognition problem of blood image analysis and how textural information can improve differentiation among leukocytes. Cooccurrence probabilities can be used as a measure of gray scale image texture, a statistical method for characterizing the spatial organization of the gray-tones. We calculate five textural attributes based on gray level cooccurrence matrices (GLCM) as energy, entropy, inertia and local homogeneity, testing these features in leukocyte recognition.

Despite the reduced vector obtained by the entropy projection, it still presents opportunity for further dimensionality reduction. Therefore, we use a Random Forest classifier as an attribute selector, providing a 97% reduction of the original vector while keeping suitable accuracy. A set of experiments using three public image databases: AR Face, Extended Yale B with occlusion and FERET illustrates the proposed methodology, evaluated using the SVM classifier. The results obtained in the experiments show promising results when compared to the available approaches in the literature, obtaining 98.05% accuracy for the complete AR Face, 97.26% for FERET and 81.66% with Yale with 50% occlusion.",2019,en,,,,
